### Sample spaces

Statistic is the logic of uncertainty.

A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment

An **event** is a subset of sample space

### Naive definetion of probability

 P(A) = #favorable outcome / #possible outcomes

Example: file coins

Assumes all outcome equally likely, finite sample space

### Sampling table

choose k objects out of n

|               | order matter     | order doesn't      |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| replace       | n^k^             | $\binom{n+k-1}{k}$ |
| don't replace | n(n-1)...(n-k+1) | $\binom{n}{k}$     |
